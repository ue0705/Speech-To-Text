# Speech-To-Text
這是一個 Python 程式，他的功能是語音轉文字 (speech to text)，原始的代碼是由 GPT-4o 產生後再加以修改的結果，由電腦的 line in (or microphone in) 來輸入後辨識, 傳統的語音辨識著重在"字"，所以常常會前後對不上，當有了人工智慧的輔助，當他可以理解你的內容後，辨識的程度與錯誤率就會大幅地降低。

然後我將聲音的輸入改成無線電訊號，在無比吵雜的環境還能夠辨識的清楚才是一個完整的功能，您可以看到裡面有一個關鍵字檢查，目的在遇到緊急情況時，可以自動的產生額外的警示功能，之後會移植到 Raspberry Pi 上執行，並且拓展成為多幾系統。

This is a Python program. Its function is speech to text. The original code is generated by GPT-4o and then modified. It is input and recognized by the computer's line in (or microphone in). Traditional speech recognition focuses on "characters", so it often fails to match the front and back. With the assistance of artificial intelligence, when it can understand your content, the degree of recognition and error rate will be greatly reduced.

Then I changed the sound input to a radio signal. It is a complete function that it can still be recognized clearly in an extremely noisy environment. You can see that there is a keyword check in it, which can automatically detect the sound in an emergency. The additional warning function will be generated and later will be transplanted to Raspberry Pi for execution and expanded into multiple systems.
